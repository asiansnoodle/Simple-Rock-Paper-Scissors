# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors coded in JavaScript.

In this project I will be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to strengthen my Frontend Development fundamentals by coding a simple game of rock paper scissors, where the user will select their choice and it will be compared with the computer's choice. 

Select a choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors and try to reach 5 wins to beat the computer!
