# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors coded in JavaScript and runs in the terminal.

In this project I will be working on my JavaScript fundamentals by coding a simple game of rock paper scissors, where the user will select their choice and it will be compared with the computer's choice. 
The game will run in the console, and the 2 files that will contain code will be the JavaScript file and the HTML file.
